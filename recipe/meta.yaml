  summary: High-Throughput Computing in Python, powered by HTCondor
  description: |
    HTMap is a library that wraps the process of mapping Python function
    calls out to an HTCondor pool.  It provides tools for submitting,
    managing, and processing the output of arbitrary functions.

    Our goal is to provide as transparent an interface as possible to
    high-throughput computing resources so that you can spend more time
    thinking about your own code, and less about how to get it running on
    a cluster.
